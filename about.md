I am a machine learning engineer at [Selvas AI](https://www.selvasai.com/en/), where I work hard to bring computer vision and deep learning to life in applications. Previously, I worked on medical imaging projects with Yoon-Chul Kim at Samsung Medical Center, and gave various talks on deep learning as a member of Microsoft Student Partners. Recently, I also have been contributing to popular open source projects including Keras and Matplotlib.
