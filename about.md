I am a machine learning engineer at <a href='https://www.selvasai.com/en/' target="_blank">Selvas AI</a>, where I work hard to bring computer vision and deep learning to life in applications. Previously, I worked on medical imaging projects with Yoon-Chul Kim at Samsung Medical Center. Deep learning has been my research interest as an undergraduate student at Sogang University, and I gave various talks on related topics as a member of Microsoft Student Partners. Also, I have been contributing to some open source projects including Keras and Matplotlib.
