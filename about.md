I am a research scientist at [VUNO Inc.](https://vuno.co), where I work hard to bring computer vision and deep learning to life in applications. Previously, I worked on medical imaging projects with [Yoon-Chul Kim](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yoon-Chul_Kim) at [Samsung Medical Center](https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Samsung_Medical_Center), and gave various talks on deep learning as a member of [Microsoft Student Partners](https://studentpartners.microsoft.com/en-US). Recently, I have been contributing to popular open source projects including [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commits?author=fuzzythecat). I am also in charge of the [official Korean translation of the Keras documentation](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-docs-ko).
